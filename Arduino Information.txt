Arduino Information

// To link files as C must use extern command.

Digital Pins Useable for Interrupt 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21

Calling PINx (where x is the port we configured) will give us the binary representation of the bins on the port ex 11110000 means the first 4 pins 7-4 are high 3-0 are low. 

Arduino AtMega2560 has 6 available timers, (two 8 bit, four 16 bit). Processor and clock at 16MHz

It looks like the servo library uses timer 5 (for the first 12 servos, make sure we set this value to low so we don't conflict multiple timers)

CTC timer mode can be used to trigger an interrupt whenever the timer reaches a certain counter value. 

use PORTA for proximity sensors

Dedicate an interrupt line for accelerometer

I2C - Needs PORTD
