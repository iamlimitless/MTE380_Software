//Blocked waiting for motor
Ramp Following Algorithm
	- Tune the controller for up the ramp
	- Finish implementing Down the ramp and flat

//Blocked waiting for motors
//Blocked waiting on ultrasonic mount
Drive Straight Algorithm
	- Tune the ultrasonic values to correct Course

//Blocked waiting for motors
//Blocked waiting on ultrasonic mount
Turning Algorithm
	- Tune IR Distance Turns
	- Turn Ultrasonic Turns and filtering

// Do something so that we start the motors high and settle so there is no initial stalling. Is this really necessary?

IR Distance Sensor Controller
	- Drive Straight Algorithm
	- How we are weaving this in with turning

Search Drift Control Algorithm
	- Design and implement

Acceleromter
	- Tune Accelerometer interrupt

Start up sequence
	- Give this some thought

Try to inline all functions
